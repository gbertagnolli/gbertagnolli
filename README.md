## Hi there 👋

<!--
**gbertagnolli/gbertagnolli** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a junior researcher at the Department of Mathematics (DIMA) of the University of Genoa, GE, Italy. My research spans different (non independent) directions: statistical models for networked, metric, and complex data; network science; information geometry.

- 🔍 I'm always (re)searching!
- 👍 I like writing code (for maths/stats models)...
- 💬 Ask me about maths (above all geometry, probability, and mathematical statistics). You'll have to stop me, eventually.
- 🥖 I love baking bread & co. with my sourdough, named "Marcellino".
